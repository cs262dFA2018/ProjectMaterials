During our testing, the team found information that will help direct the production of EventConnect. To begin, we asked our subjects about their experience with creating and using Facebook events. Facebook appears to be the primary source of event creation between our subjects. We discovered that most people do not see consistent results between people who say they can come to events, and who will actually show up. 
In terms of the app itself, we found the subjects agree that the app helped defeat the psychology of typical event planning applications like Facebook. In order to continue this, we have decided to not display each event’s set threshold on the card when viewed by anyone other than the host.
We have already started beautifying the app, including fixing the changing button sizes between each tab. We have also discovered an issue with button labels not switching themes between “light” and “dark” mode. This is most likely caused by lag between the emulators on Android Studio. 
One of the user tasks we had each subject perform was indicating their loss of interest in an event, and in turn moving the event back to the “interested” tab. The test subjects would occasionally press the “delete” button. This was subverted by the confirmation dialog that would appear, but caused some confusion. We have been aware of this problem, and we are currently discussing possible solutions. This will differentiate the two buttons and eliminate the problem. 
These tests have been incredibly enlightening in our development process. We hope to implement as many improvements as possible before the final deliverable.
