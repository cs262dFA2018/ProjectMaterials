## Project Vision
EventConnect is an event and activity coordinating app that allows its users to easily suggest ideas and make plans. Users could suggest an event (order food from Pizza Hut, Smash Bros. Tournament, carpool to Meijer) which would appear in other users’ feeds. Those users can then indicate their interest through a voting system. Each event idea could have a life span as to not stay in the feed for too long. This would be set by the idea owner, along with minimum and maximum levels of interest. If an appropriate amount of interest in the event was indicated, the suggestion would switch from idea mode to event mode and connect the interested parties to make plans.

Many event coordinators have to deal with people being non-commital when making plans. This is prevalent in social and professional settings a like. There is a need to make concrete plans based on agreed criteria. EventConnect is an event planner app that clearly lists the event, location, time, people interested, and if the event will proceed, or if not enough people agreed to make the event viable. Many event apps simply provide the event as if it is guaranteed to happen, such as Facebook Events, so invited guests can be less committal and assume others will come to fill their absence. EventConnect guarantees that enough people are committed, using a social contract to bring invited guests to an event.
